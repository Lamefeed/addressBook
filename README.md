# The AddressBook!


As of writing this the addressbook program is in pre-alpha, this will change as I've what I consider to be the 
required amount of features to call it alpha.
As you might already know this program only supports CLI(command line interface), this is to push people into becoming comfy using such a powerfull tool.


## Features as we speak
* Adding people
* Printing everything
* Searching for people in the book
* Editing existing people
* Exporting from db to a different medium(for backup)

## Features to be added
* Importing from some medium to db

## Branches
The branches are as following:
* Master(Stable)
* Beta(Development)

## Run
Requirements:
* python 3.6

## What's next
### Making a graphical user interface so that all the normies can use this addressbook. I will also update the CLI client so that it looks better than what it currently does.
