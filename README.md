# The AddressBook!


As of writing this the addressbook program is in pre-alpha, this will change as I've what I consider to be the 
required amount of features to call it alpha.
As you might already know this program only supports CLI(command line interface), this is to push people into becoming comfy using such a powerfull tool.


## Features as we speak
* Adding people
* Printing everything
* Searching for people in the book

## Features to be added
* Editing existing people
* Exporting from db to a different medium(for backup)
* Importing from some medium to db


## Run
Requirements:
* python 3


## What's next


More will come as time passes, I will be spending most of my sparetime over the next year creating this program
